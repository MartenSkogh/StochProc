# Words and Terms

## Bayesian Statistics

1. **Improper density** - "Probability" density that integrates to infinity.

## Markov Chains

1. **Stochastic matrix** - Matrix of all positive or zero values where each row sums to 1.
1. **Regular stochastic matrix** - All entries of any positive power > 1 of the matrix are positive.
1. **Irreducuble Markov chain** - All states communicate, there is only one communication class.
1. **Limiting distribution**
1. **Stationary distribution**
1. **Communication class**
1. **Transcient** - A communication class that is transient is not closed, you can exit the class. Given enough steps, you will eventually exit this class.
1. **Recurrence** - A communication class that is recurrent is closed, you can not exit the class if you enter it.
1. **Markov Chain periodicity** - The number of steps required to get back to the original state.
1. **Ergodic Markov Chain** - Irreducible, aperiodic and all states have a finite return time.
1. **Time reversibility** - There is no prefered direction in the graph when in the stationary distribution.
1. **Absorbing Markov chain** - A markov chain with a finite number of absorbing states.
1. **Fundamental matrix** - Gives the expected number of visits to a transient state from another transient state.

 ## Branching Processes


## Poisson Processes

1. **Memorylessness** - 
1. **Thinned Poisson process** -
